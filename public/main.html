  <h4>League of Legends or "LoL" for short is one of the worlds most successful and popular games. As a pc gamer myself it can become very addicting. There is a lot of strategy involved and a champion for everyone. What inspired me for this app was being able to strategize and compile data for each champion. Most importantly the selection phase can determine whether a game will go smoothly or not.</h4>

  <br>

  <h4>Everyone can contribute to this app by adding a champion to the tracker tab and adding/deleting notes of strengths, weaknesses, item builds, stats, comments, and playstyles in order to gain better knowledge of a character (especially since there are so many to choose from!).</h4>
